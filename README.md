# Zurvival Capstone
Zurvival is an arcade zombie shooter with round/wave-based systems and new level unlocks after achieving a certain round while also maintaining an accurate score count for zombies killed. Zombies will increase in number every round so be prepared for the onslaught of different enemies. Zurvival will test players' ability to escape and kill the merciless, violent, and incredibly fast hordes of undead. How long can you survive? Will you make it to the next stage?

## Getting Started
The first level introduced (Level 1) is a tutorial level designed to allow players to get used to controls and how many shots it may take to kill a zombie. It functions as a normal map, however, after completing 1 wave (killing 1 zombie) you will unlock the next level, though players may use this area to practice. After finishing the first round and dying in the practice chamber, players can then return to the main menu and begin Level 2. If you are still confused please follow the tutorial video below listed in the [How To Play](#How-To-Play).
